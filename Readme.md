SLIM
====

Slim is a package manager for Typescript. It analyze your code to efficiently shake off non-used function. It is also a package manager for Client-Server Rendered Applications. It allows pre-processing code block inclusion for each platform—client or server. It addresses some of the big problem with node applications being very heavy in code. Each member of this package management tool must pay a yearly fee—this fee is later shared through module owners and maintainers. The formula for sharing revenue is based on the amount of code and popularity of the module.

## Module
```typescript
/// <reference path="Test.ts" />

module Application {
  export default class Slim {
    test1() {
      ...
    },

    /// @if client
    // Public functions
    test2() {
      this.test();
    },
    /// @endif

    // Private function
    // @client
    test3_() {
      ...
    }
  }
}

```

If I later decides in an another file to only use method `test3()`. Then, method `test2()` will not be compiled. Assuming that only two files are used through out your application.

```javascript
/// <reference path="Application" />
var slim = new Application.Slim();
slim.test3();
```

## Annotations
You must make annotations in your code to mark if a function is for server-side or client-side usage.

### Client-side usage:
```
/// @if client
/// @endif
```

### Server-side usage:
```
/// @if server
/// @endif
```

### Server-side or client side usage:
```
/// @if server
/// @else
/// @endif
```

## Implementation

Slim uses TypeScript's compiler API to compile files. Though it uses its' own internal API:s to do some pre-processing first. The pre-processing steps includes function shaking and conditional include filtering.

## CLI methods

### install
`slim install` will install all your modules.

`slim install <module_name>` will install `module_name`.

`slim install <module_name> -g` will install `module_name` globally.

### publish
`slim publish` will publish your module to a public repo.

### test
